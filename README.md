# 🚀 A Custom VLSI Cell Library

This repository contains a compact VLSI cell library designed for educational and experimental purposes. It includes full schematics, simulations, and layouts for basic digital logic gates and components.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Cadence Virtuoso** – for schematic capture and layout design  
- **Cadence Spectre** – for circuit simulation  
- **Calibre (Mentor Graphics)** – for DRC and LVS verification

## 📁 Contents
