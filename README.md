# 🚀 NanoLogic: A Custom VLSI Cell Library

This repository contains a compact VLSI cell library designed for educational and experimental purposes. It includes full schematics, simulations, and layouts for basic digital logic gates and components.

## 📁 Contents

- ✅ **Schematic Designs**
  - NAND, NOR, AND, OR, XOR, Inverter
  - Transmission Gate (TG)
  - 2x1 Multiplexer (MUX)

- 🧪 **Simulation Results**
  - Waveform verification for all logic components

- 🧱 **Layout & Verification**
  - Custom layouts optimized for area efficiency
  - DRC (Design Rule Check) passed
  - LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) clean

## ⚙️ Design Features

- Tapless layout techniques to prevent latch-up
- Multi-finger shared source/drain transistors for compact design and reduced routing complexity

## 📐 Layout Area

3.175μm × 2.145μm = 6.810375
